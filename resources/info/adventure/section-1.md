# Adventure

Adventures in Tlessa can only be triggered by being on a specific location that has an adventure.

For example, you might be at a port and see the Adventure button under the map or at a ruin and see the Adventure button.

Locations on the map can be clicked on and show you the location data including any adventures that specific location has.

Below you can see a current list of all adventures in the game.

The more floors an adventure has the more time an adventure takes to complete.
