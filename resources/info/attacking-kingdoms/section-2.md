As you can see each unit has its own building, level that building must be to recruit and the costs associated with the units them selves.

Now that you have some units, where are all the kingdoms?

This is the fun part, you must move around the map, until you see, in the actions section, attack kingdom.

This makes use of the map aside from moving around to locations and ports. Once you find another players kingdom you can begin the attack process:

[Attack dialogue]

From here your first step is to select the kingdoms you want to attack from. Each kingdom has its own set of units and the further away a kingdom is from the target, the longer it takes the units to travel there, but also to return from there.

> ## ATTN
> 
> Should you not have any kingdoms or units in any kingdoms, you will not see the
> attack button light up.
> 
> The attack button may still be visible if you send all your units to the kingdom you are attacking,
> however, reopening it will show you a notice that you have no kingdoms to attack from.

Let us send out some units:

[Send Units]

Now that we have our kingdoms, you can see here, a list of boxes that you can click on to select the number of available units you want to send, each box will tell you how long from that kingdom to the defending kingdom, but underneath the boxes you will see the grand total of time (across all kingdoms) and the total units to send (across all kingdoms)

Once you click attack, you can then go to your unit movement section

[Menu Image]

To see the units in movement. You cancel the unit movement by clicking on the row on the table. If, they are too close to their target they will not be recalled.

Once a kingdom is attacked, and the units return a log will be generated. If you lost all your units in the attack, you would get a log right away.

When you attack a kingdom, you&#39;ll see a global message go out:

[global message]

As well as a server message for when the units land their attack

[server message]

If you are not online and have the appropriate settings enabled, you will get an email when the attack lands, an attack lands on you or your kingdom is taken. The other time we can email you,
is if your kingdom comes under attack.

When you see the message popup in chat, there is no way to tell how long till that attack lands, be it yours or theirs. For yours you can see unit movement as well as where
they are going. However, for incoming attacks, there is no way to know till they land.

## Attacking to take over

To take over another kingdom you need a special unit that must be sent with regular unit&#39;s, not siege units or healers. For example, send them with archers or spearmen.

The unit in question is a settler. These units can reduce a morale of a kingdom by 10%. If the morale of the kingdom is 0%, they will take the kingdom and you will have a new kingdom.

[Global Take Over Message]

If you send multiple settlers with your units to take the kingdom, it will not work. First, settlers do not return. They die. So, you would be wasting settlers if you sent 5-6 at a time.

Instead, the best method is to chain the attacks to take a kingdom, send your siege units in first, then send in your units to attack and take the kingdom. Siege units such as trebuchets and rams will help destroy walls and buildings and farms, when a kingdom building fall the kingdoms, morale is instantly recalculated, so chaining attacks with siege weapons and settlers is the best way to go.

> ## ATTN!
> 
> Be careful of unit movement, for example if you send out 160 trebuchets, 300 rams and some soldiers, and a settler - that group of units will move slower than 
> a set of spearmen and a settler.
> 
> The best approach is to queue up similar movement times with multiple settlers.
> 
> You can send settlers with any units that can attack and defend except priests, rams and trebuchets.
> 
> **Do not send settlers alone.**

## Attacking does not get you resources

If you plan to attack kingdoms for resources, you will be sorry. The only reason to attack another kingdom is to take it. The more kingdoms, the more treasure you can embezzle per hour from them.

You get no resources, no gold, no nothing from straight up attacking another kingdom.
