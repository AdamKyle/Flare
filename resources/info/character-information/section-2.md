## Classes

As mentioned before the races as you can see have stat modifiers, now we select a class.

Each class has its own damage stat, this is the stat you want to focus on the most when it comes out equipping your character
with the best gear.

For example if your select Vampire, your base damage stat, is your durabillity. Durability affects not just your health but also your damage in this particular case, so you will want to equip gear based on that durabillity stat to do the most damage.

With that said, you can equip what ever you want, you are not limited to what your character can or cannot equip, how ever gear more attuned to your stat will give you better damage numbers when facing off againt creatures.
