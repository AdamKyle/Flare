## Classes

Before we complete our character, we need to assign the character a class.

Each class has its own damage stat, this is the stat you want to focus on the most when it comes out equipping your character
with the best gear.

For example if your select Vampire, your base damage stat is your durability. This would mean the best race would be Dark Dwarf or Centaur. Durability affects not just your health but also your damage in this particular case, so you will want to equip gear based on that durability stat to do the most damage.

### Base Stats

All characters start with 10 points in all their core stats. The race and class you select will add aditional points to the idicated stats.

Armour Class, or AC, is always a base of 10.

### Difference Between Can Hit and Blocking

When it comes to picking a Race and Class you should be mindful of the classes `damage stat`. When a character goes to attack we take into account two things and thus two different stats along with skills, equipment and any other bonuses.

These two things are your damage stat and your dexterity.

When it comes to being able to hit: Can Hit, we check your dexterity plus your accracy bonus, which comes from your skill training in accuracy and any other bonuses you may have towards accuracy or dexterity, against their dexterity plus their dodge skill bonus.

When it comes to blocking its your base damage stat plus your accuracy bonuses against their AC.

The vice versa works when you are the defender.

> While yes you want to focus on your primary stat, what ever that is for the class you chose, you must also focus on your dexterity as well for be able to dodge the attacks coming in as well as land attacks.

### Skill Modifiers

The class table below, is a simple display of how stats modify your abillities. Clicking on them allows you to see more details, such as the accuracy and dodge modification which is important when it comes to fights. You can learn more about skills in the [skills section](/information/skill-information).

In this case:

- **Accuracy**: Affects your chance to hit versus the monsters Dodge skill.
- **Dodge**: Affects your chance to dodge versus the monsters Accuracy skill.

Lets see what classes you can pick from:
