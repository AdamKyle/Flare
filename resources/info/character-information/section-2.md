## Classes

Before we complete our character, we need to assign the character a class.

Each class has its own damage stat, this is the stat you want to focus on the most when it comes out equipping your character
with the best gear.

For example if your select Vampire, your base damage stat is your durabillity. This would mean the best race would be Dark Dwarf or Centaur. Durability affects not just your health but also your damage in this particular case, so you will want to equip gear based on that durabillity stat to do the most damage.

### Skill Modifiers

In the table below you will see some skill modifiers for Accuracy and Dodge. These particular skills are apat of a array of skills that you can train and advance. You can learn about skills in the [skills section](/information/skill-information).

In this case:

- **Accuracy**: Affects your chance to hit versus the monsters Dodge skill.
- **Dodge**: Affects your chance to dodge versus the monsters Accuracy skill.

Lets see what classes you can pick from:
