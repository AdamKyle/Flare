## Create your character how you want

While yes, the stats direct you to pick the best race and class to begind your journey and yes there is indiciation that you should select the best equipment that helps increae your primary damage stat, you are always free to make your own way, mix and max races and classes that might not fit together, completly ignore your core stat and equip what ever you want.

This might limit your damage potential, but you are always free to do as you want with your character in terms of how you grow and evolve them.
