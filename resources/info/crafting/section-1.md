# Crafting

Crafting in Tlessa is simple and designed to be that way. The first thing to know is you have a set of skills specifically designed for crafting.

You don't have to gather anything or spend time training these skills in battle. These skill are trained by physically crafting the item.

You will craft a at least 10 to a maximum of 20 items with no bonuses before being able to gain a level.

Failing to craft the item will cost you the gold you need to craft the item and you'll get no experience points.

**The crafting skills are:**

- **Weapon Crafting**: lets you craft all weapon based items.
- **Armour Crafting**: lets you craft all armour based items.
- **Ring Crafting**: lets you craft all ring based items.
- **Spell Crafting**: lets you craft all spell based items.
- **Artifact Crafting**: lets you craft all artifact based item.

Gaining levels increases your skill bonus, which increases the odds of the item being created.

## Pay attention to chat

Chat will inform you of success/failure and gold deficiency when it comes to crafting.

## Limited Items

You can only craft items of the type selected, at any time, by clicking additional actions, can you remove the crafting section or change the type.

As you level your crafting skill, more items will be unlocked for that type.

## The Cost of crafting

The cost to craft an item is based on the items base cost. If the character doesnt have the gold, you wont be able to craft the item.

Think of the cost as the "materials needed" cost.

## Crafted items are useless without enchanting them

The whole point of crafting items is to then enchant them. Sure you can craft your self a new suit of armour and a new weapon, but you can't then sell that on the market board. Theres money to be made in enchanting gear.

Echantments are what make gear unique, you can enchant gear to your specific needs. More on that in [Enchanting](/information/enchanting)

# List of Craftable Items

All items in the table can be clicked on by their name. We use color coding to determine item "rarity" for example:
