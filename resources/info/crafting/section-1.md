# Crafting

Crafting in Tlessa is simple and designed to be that way. The first thing to know is you have a set of skills specifically designed for crafting.

You don't have to gather anything or spend time training these skills in battle. These skill are trained by physically crafting the item.

You will craft a at least 10 to a maximum of 20 items with no bonuses before being able to gain a level.

Failing to craft the item will cost you the gold you need to craft the item and you'll get no experience points.

**The crafting skills are:**

- **Weapon Crafting**: lets you craft all weapon based items.
- **Armour Crafting**: lets you craft all armour based items.
- **Spell Crafting**: lets you craft all ring based items.
- **Artifact Crafting**: lets you craft all artifact based item.

Gaining levels increases your skill bonus, which increases the odds of the item being created.

> ### ATTN!

> All crafting comes with a 10 second timeout. You may attack and move, set sail, embark on an adventure or teleport while the timer runs.

## The Cost of crafting

The cost to craft an item is based on the items base cost. If the character doesnt have the gold, you wont be able to craft the item.

Think of the cost as the "materials needed" cost.

## Crafted items are useless without enchanting them

The whole point of crafting items is to then enchant them. Sure you can craft your self a new suit of armour and a new weapon, but you can't then sell that on the market board. Theres money to be made in enchanting gear.

Echantments are what make gear unique, you can enchant gear to your specific needs. More on that in [Enchanting](/information/enchanting)
