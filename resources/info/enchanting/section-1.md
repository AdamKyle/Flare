# Enchanting

Enchanting, like crafting, is also meant to be easy. Although has a slight difference from how crafting works.

Tou enchant an item, you will select the item from your inventory. This will consist of a item that is not a quest and is not equipped.

This item may have affixes attached.

From here you will select the suffix, prefix or both.

If the item already has an enchantment on it, for each additional enchantment the item has an additional ten seconds will be added to the default ten seconds.

For example, a Rusty Bloody Broken Dagger with no enchantments will result in a ten second time out, with one enchantement the time out is 20 seconds, with two the time out is 30 seconds.

Each additional 10 seconds is for the disenchanting or removal of previous enchantment which is done automatically for you when you succeed.

For each affix, you roll to see if you can enchant. Your roll is the Enchanting skill bonus along with any other relvant bonus. 

If you fail to enchant the item, weather is be with one enchant or two, the item and the gold required to do so are lost for ever. This is where it gets dicey for low level characters who have a low level enchanting skill and want to attach two enchantments to an item because if they appky the first enchantment and fail to apply the second, the gold and item are lost.

## Requirments for enchanting

You need intelligence for this. Your character might want to invest in a fullset of intelligence based gear when enchanting as it gives them more of a bonus. If your enchanting with extremly high intelligence, which is greator then the intelligence needed to apply the enchantment, the check will be halfed because of your intelligence.

Enchanting items that are considered too easy will automatically and always pass. you just wont get the XP.

> ### ATTN!!
>
> If the player is enchanting an item with two enchantments and one of those items is well below the characters enchanting level, but the other is not, the character will recive xp for the enchantment above or at their level.

## Cost to enchant

The cost of the enchanting is the cost of the enchantment its self plus the cost to remove any previous enchantments + 10% for "materials".

Enchanting is not cheap and should be considered like a gold sink. Enchantments can start at as little as 1000 gold and go up to 2 billion, the games maximum gold cap for a character.

Enchanted items cannot be sold via the shop. They can be destroyed and traded as well as sold on the market board. This provides a great way for the player to make some money.
