# Enchanting

Enchanting, like crafting, is also meant to be easy. Although has a slight difference from how crafting works.

To enchant an item, you will select the item from your inventory. This will consist of a item that is not a quest and is not equipped.

This item may have affixes attached.

From here you will select the suffix, prefix or both.

If the item already has an enchantment on it, for each additional enchantment the item has an additional ten seconds will be added to the default ten seconds.

For exmple if a Rusty Bloddy Broken Dagger has  a suffix on it, and you are attempting to replace the suffix, you will recieve a 20 second time out. How ever if you wanted to add a prefix it would be 10 second timeout.

If, how ever, you are attempting to replace two enchantments on an item, it will be a 30 second timeout.

Each additional 10 seconds is for the disenchanting or removal of previous enchantment which is done automatically for you when you succeed.

For each affix, you roll to see if you can enchant. Your roll is the Enchanting skill bonus along with any other relvant bonus. 

If you fail to enchant the item, weather is be with one enchant or two, the item and the gold required to do so are lost for ever. This is where it gets dicey for low level characters who have a low level enchanting skill and want to attach two enchantments to an item because if they appky the first enchantment and fail to apply the second, the gold and item are lost.

## Requirments for enchanting

All you need is the gold, the items and the time to level. Enchanting can be an interesting gold sink as more and more enchantments get added to the game. Enchantments are meant to be expensive, as they can add significant advantage in overcoming difficult enemies or adventures.

## Cost to enchant

The cost is the enchantment cost + half the original cost of the already attached enchantment.

That is, if you have an item with one enchantment and you want to replace it, it will be:

The cost of the enchantment you want (ie, 1000) + half the cost of the enchantment to be replaced (ie, 500) for a total of 1500.

Enchanted items cannot be sold via the shop. They can be destroyed and traded as well as sold on the [market]() board. This provides a great way for the player to make some money.

## Double enchanting with faliure

Sometimes when applying two enchants you might see something like this:

What this means is:

- The first enchant worked, you were awarded EXP.
- The second enchant failed, thus you lost the item and the investment and got no EXP for the second enchantment.
