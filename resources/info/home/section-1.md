## The biggest selling points

- No Timeouts/Daily Limits<sup>*</sup>.
- No Set it and forget it.
- Nothing in game can be baught.
- Simple and easy game to learn and play.

<sup>*</sup> There are timers, these do not last long. You can read about these in [Time Gates](/information/time-gates).

## Progression while offline

If you are on and adventure, and you log out - don't worry. We got you! You'll get an email when the adventure is over. Of course, we know you might not want us to email you, that’s why you can turn that off in the settings section for your account.

Any event that takes longer than a few milliseconds will carry on in the background. All timers, even if you close the corresponding section holding the timer, will also pick right back up where it was, assuming it's not finished.

## Community Driven

Tlessa is a community driven game. The chat is where we show you notifications, server-side messages as well as allowing you to chat and private message with other players.

We have minimum notifications, for example completing adventures will email you if you are not online.

The chat section is where all the action really is. This is where characters can chat to each other, but beware – chatting while standing in your kingdom gives away your position – making it easy for players to swoop in and take your kingdoms.

Players are encouraged to chat and trade with each other via the market boards and journey together through the world exploring the various adventures.

Last but not least, don't forget the [rules](/information/rules) before chatting.
