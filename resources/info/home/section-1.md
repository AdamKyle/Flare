# Planes Of Tlessa
------------------

Welcome traveler! I am glad you could stop by. Sit for a moment, I have something I want to
share with you. A magical, mystical world, where you can be anything you want. Craft and enchant the highest quality gear, sell it on the market to become rich!
Maybe you want to adventure deep into the dungeons and fight off fearsome monsters, train up the battle skills and loot all the items!

Or perhaps you want to settle a kingdom or two, or three or all of them!

You have come to the right place my friend; you have come to The Planes of Tlessa!

## Biggest Selling Points!

-	**No real-world money can be used to buy any item or advancement**. You want it? You earn it!
-	**Not completely idle based**. Some players might find this upsetting and that’s ok, that just means this isn’t the game for you. We do have some idle based mechanics, such as adventuring and kingdoms, however if you are looking to set it and forget it, that’s not Tlessa!
-	**No Energy Systems!** Instead we use what are called: [time gates](/information/time-gates). These can range from 10 seconds to a few minutes! The goal is for you to stay engaged!
-	**Simple and easy interface**. The goal of Tlessa is to be easy to understand. Everything is laid out for you in a way where you know instinctively what a button does, or an action does.
-	**Real time chat and offline progression are a thing!** Want to chat with your friends? You can in real time including private messaging them! (see [rules](/information/rules)). Have to log out, but you are in the middle of an adventure? Don’t worry we got you, go about your day, you’ll get an email when it’s completed, assuming you have those settings turned on.
-	**Not another MCCodes clone or Maffia game! Completely Unique!**
-	**Completely open source!** Found a bug, want a feature? Make a pull request!

These are some of the biggest selling points of the game. I wanted to create a game that was something I would play. Every day, all day. 

My inspiration came from other similar PBBG’s in this manner. Choosing to keep things text based allowed for the development process to move along much faster.

## How do you make money?

I don't. I have a full time job that pays for the server cost. I develop and fix isues and add new features when I have time, making sure to be active in game as well as on discord for any issues that might arise.

How ever, due to having a real world job, time delays on fixing issues, unless they are causing the game to fall over, might take a little longer.

- **You**: *So wait, theirs no adds, no "special currency", no way you are making money from the game. Does that mean it's completly free?*
- **Me**: *Now you get it.*
