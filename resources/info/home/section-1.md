# Planes Of Tlessa
------------------

Welcome traveler! I am glad you could stop by. Sit for a moment, I have something I want to
share with you. A magical, mystical world, where you can be anything you want. Craft and enchant the highest quality gear, sell it on the market to become rich!
Maybe you want to adventure deep into the dungeons and fight off fearsome monsters, train up the battle skills and loot all the items!

Or perhaps you want to settle a kingdom or two, or three or all of them!

You have come to the right place my friend; you have come to The Planes of Tlessa!

## Biggest Selling Points!

-	**No real-world money can be used to buy any item or advancement**. You want it? You earn it!
-	**Not completely idle based**. Some players might find this upsetting and that’s ok, that just means this isn’t the game for you. We do have some idle based mechanics, such as adventuring and kingdoms, however if you are looking to set it and forget it, that’s not Tlessa!
-	**No Energy Systems!** Instead we use what are called: [time gates](/information/time-gates). These can range from 10 seconds to a few minutes! The goal is for you to stay engaged!
-	**Simple and easy interface**. The goal of Tlessa is to be easy to understand. Everything is laid out for you in a way where you know instinctively what a button does, or an action does.
-	**Real time chat and offline progression are a thing!** Want to chat with your friends? You can in real time including private messaging them! (see [rules](/information/rules)). Have to log out, but you are in the middle of an adventure? Don’t worry we got you, go about your day, you’ll get an email when it’s completed, assuming you have those settings turned on.
-	**Completely open source!** Found a bug, want a feature? Make a pull request! See the [source here](https://github.com/AdamKyle/flare)

These are some of the biggest selling points of the game. I wanted to create a game that was something I would play. **Every day, all day**. 

With that said, some players might be put off by the “not everyone is limited” by some kind of energy system allowing players to essentially play all day, every day. This can mean that someone who has more time than you, can get ahead of you. 

But that doesn’t mean you are less then. There is no end game. You make of it what you want. If you want to rule the markets, you will craft items, enchant them and sell them.

If you want to rule the land, you’ll settle kingdoms and take your opponents kingdoms. There is faction system here, no clans. It’s every man, woman and child for themselves.

If you want to just find the longest running adventure and run that over and over again for the loot to sell on the market, then go ahead.

There is something for everyone, it just depends on what you want to do? Run the markets? Run the kingdoms? Go on every adventure? You can do it all.

## Why?

It's simple really. I wanted to make a game that I wanted to play with inspiration from games I have played. Thats really the main purpose. I am a software developer by trade, it's what I do all day, every day. So why not use my down time to create something. 

I was really inspired by a game called [Race War Kingdoms](https://www.racewarkingdoms.com/) as well as a few other games. I wanted to keep things simple, clean and easy to use. But I wanted to expand on some systems and make them easier and more enjoyable to use.

## FAQ

- **Where are the cash shops or currency shops to buy items or gold**: As stated through out this information section, there is no way your money will get you any where in game because there is no cash shop or way for you to spend real world money.

- **How do you make money, are there adds?**: There are no adds, I make no money off this game what so ever. It is completely open source. In order to pay for server costs, I have a job and a credit card.

- **How do I get rid of [time gates](/information/time-gates)**: You don't. This is how we slow you down a bit and stop you from overwhelming the server. There are some quest items that will reduce the time out by 25%, how ever you'll have to earn those. You cannot buy them.

- **What Browsers are supported?**: Anything other than any version of Internet Explorer. This game will never support Internet Explorer, but we do support Edge. (Javascript is a must)

- **Mobile looks pretty broken**: My main priority was to make sure the game aspect is functional in mobile. Other pages may be broken. These are being fixed. Information section and the home page as well as releases, login, registration and other non in game forms are all mobile responsive.
