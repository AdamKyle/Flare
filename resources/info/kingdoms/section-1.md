# Kingdoms

One of the key aspects of Planes of Tlessa is to allow you to settle kingdoms. Kingdoms in Tlessa work differently than other kingdom management games you might have played or are used to. With some similarities but my own spin on it.

Borrowing the idea of settling kingdoms from [racewarkingdoms](), I have made some changes to way they work here.

First, to settle a kingdom you simply move to any location that is not a port or special location. You’ll know if you can settle a kingdom by seeing this button appear in the actions section:

[Image here]

From here you may click Settle Kingdom, this will open a popup:

[Image here]

You’ll type in a name. Kingdom names must be between 5 and 15 characters. Spaces are allowed.

Now you’ll select a color for your kingdom. You are free to choose any color.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> Your kingdom color opacity cannot be below 50%.

Once that’s done, you’ll click settle and from there a new modal window will popup:

[Image here].

As you can see, we start by listing your resources along with basic information about your kingdom including resources gained per hour, morale gained/lost per hour and so on.

Under that information, there are two tabs: Buildings and Units.

You can click on the row in the table to see the details of what it costs to upgrade a building as well as what you’ll gain from upgrading that building including time to upgrade the building. The higher the level the more time it takes as well as resources.

Some buildings such as keep, walls, farm and barracks will cause your kingdom to loose morale per hour if they fall to a durability of zero.

For example, lets upgrade our walls:

[image here]

Here you can see the current durability and current defence as well as current level. Next, we have how much morale this building will give you per hour and how much you will lose per hour should the durability fall to zero.

> ### ATTN!
> 
>You can click and drag the modal, by clicking and dragging the title, this way you can see what resources you have in comparison to what you need, in this case we have the resources, indicated by the: Can Upgrade being yes.

> ### ATTN
>
>You may only upgrade a building up one level at a time. You must wait for that building to finish upgrading before queueing it for the next level.

The cost in resources also goes up per level.

In this case we need a specific number of resources, including population.

Under the cost section is what changes to the building including any additional resources per hour. Since walls are not a resource building, we gain nothing there, but our defence and durability do go up.

You will also notice that it will take 7 minutes to upgrade the building. Let’s upgrade this.

Notice how you had a building queue and unit queue tab? Let’s click on the building queue tab:

[Image here]

Here you can see our building is upgrading, if we click the row in the table for that building:

[image here]

You can see we can cancel the building; we can do the same thing for units in the unit queue.

> ## ATTN!
>
> Canceling a building takes the time it started and the time it will complete as well as the time left to calculate how many resources, including population, percentage wise, you’ll get back. If the building is almost done upgrading you won’t be able to cancel because the builder is almost done, and you would get less then 10% materials back.
>
> You will see a notice if you attempt to cancel when you have, for example a few minutes or seconds left.

Once the building is done, assuming you are logged in you’ll see it in chat:

[image here]

If you are not logged in, you’ll receive an email.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> If you have multiple buildings in queue and you logout, you’ll receive multiple emails when they are finished, one for each building that finishes when its finished. You can turn this off in the settings page.

The same will happen for units (see below).

When your kingdom gains resources per hour you’ll see:

[image here]

In chat. If you are not logged in, you’ll receive an email for each kingdom that updated. Again, you can turn this off in the settings page.

Resources are gained once per hour.

## Units

Now that we have upgraded a building, lets discuss units.

Let’s open up our kingdom by clicking “Manage Kingdom” as see in the image below:

[Image here]

Once your kingdom is open let’s click the units tab at the bottom, beside buildings:

[Image here]

You might be thinking: Where are all my units, I only have one unit.

That’s because you need to upgrade the barracks, at specific levels you can gain more units to recruit. See the unit table below:

[table here for units]

Let’s recruit some basic spearmen. Just like with buildings, you can click the row in the table for the unit you want to recruit:

[image here]

As we can see, we have a slider for how many spearmen you want to recruit. You also see your current population.

Let’s select some spearmen:

> ### ATTN!
> 
> You can only recruit as many units as you have population and resources. The numbers in unit cost section of the modal will go up as you select more. If the numbers go red, you will not be able to recruit as you don’t have the resources. If they go green, you will be able to recruit the units.

[Image here]

As we can see, we can recruit some of these spearmen because the unit cost is all green. You also notice that the attack and defence will also increase as a calculation of total units * one unit’s defence and attack.

We can see how much population this will require but we also see the time that it will take. The more you recruit the longer it takes.

In our case it will take 30 minutes or .50 hours to recruit the amount we want.

We also can see that these are defender-based units. They can be sent off to attack, more on that later, however they are best as defenders. These units are weak against Axe men. (More on that later)

When we are ready to recruit, we can click Recruit Selected beside the slider. If the recruit button is disabled, that means our unit cost has some red in it, and that means we don’t have the resources to recruit the amount we want.

We can cancel a recruitment the same way we do for buildings (by clicking unit queue at the top of the kingdom management modal and clicking on the unit you want to cancel in the table). 

[image here]

The same rules apply, it’s the time from you clicked the recruit, to the time it finished with the amount of time left. If the amount, percentage wise, is less then 10% you won’t be able to cancel because you are almost done.

Just like for buildings you will only get a percentage of resources back based on the time left.

[image here]

If you are not logged in and you have multiple units in queue, as they finish, you’ll get an email for each one that finished. Again, you can turn this off in the settings page. If you are logged in the chat will update to show you how many total units, you have now when that unit is finished. If you previously recruited 100 spearmen, and then recruit another 100, you’ll see chat update to tell you that you now have 200 spearmen.

## Regarding timers

All timers are server side with client-side representations. You are free to logout, move away from the kingdom, go on adventures, craft, go manage other kingdoms and so on. These timers will process in the background for you.

## Managing multiple kingdoms.

In order to manage your many kingdoms, as they grow – The creator decided not to allow you to have an overall kingdom management section. Instead, you must physically move to your kingdoms. This is why a lot of people will end up settling kingdoms next to each other, eventually creating what are called plexes.

> ### ATTN!
>
> Plexes is a term borrowed from racewarkingdoms, this is where you have, for example: 50 kingdoms (or less) in a square or a line. Usually a giant square filled in with kingdoms.

## Attacking other kingdoms

We will discuss this in further detail in the attacking section of this guide, however, as you noticed your kingdoms show up for you and only you on the map:

[image]

To find another person’s kingdom, you must travel around the map. Once you find another person’s kingdom, you’ll see an attack button appear in the action section:

[image]

You won’t see their kingdom on the map, but this button indicates you found someone’s kingdom and can attack it. More on that in the [Attacking a kingdom]() section.

## Embezzling 

When it comes to embezzling the gold from your kingdom, you can click the treasury link at the top of the kingdom management window. From here you can embezzle any amount of treasure that you currently have which accumulates per hour.

Every time you embezzle, regardless of how much, your kingdom will loose 15% morale. If your kingdom is at
or below the 15% morale threshold or has no treasure to embezzle you will not be able to embezzle from your
kingdom.

If your kingdom is taken, by another player, your treasury will be lost. That does not mean the other player
will gain that treasure. Instead the treasure is considered lost and will reset to 0.

## Additional Tips

- Settling one kingdom is free, settling additional kingdoms cost 10,000 gold per kingdom you own. For example, if you have 5 kingdoms, your 6th will cost 50,000 gold. If you don’t have the gold, you can Attack other kingdoms, reduce their morale to 0 and send in a special unit called a “settler” who will settle the kingdom. See [Attacking a kingdom]().
- If you are banned for ever, see [rules](), and you have not requested a “unban” or have been rejected for one, after 72 hours of the ban taking affect the kingdoms will be taken from your kingdom and given to an NPC (legit just called NPC). The NPC will hold the kingdom at 0% Morale. All a player has to do is either message the NPC and ask to take the kingdom (cost is total Kingdoms you own * 10,000 gold / 2 – half price!) or you can send a settler in and just take the kingdom.
  - When a player is banned and their kingdoms are handed over to the NPC, players in chat will see a gold
    message appearing saying that Player x’s kingdoms were handed to an NPC.
    - No location data will be given. Go hunting.
  - If you request an unban after the 72 hour period and are acquitted (unbanned) your kingdoms will be lost for ever and you have to start all over.
- A player who has more than 50 kingdoms must walk them daily or suffer 10% morale loss per day on all those kingdoms.
- A player who has more than 100 kingdoms must walk them daily or suffer 25% morale loss.
- A player with more than 250 kingdoms must walk them daily or suffer 50% morale loss.
- Once a kingdom loses all its morale it will gain no treasury, and no resources.
  - Buildings with zero durability will need to be repaired at half the cost of the building cost for that level, before you can upgrade or (in the case of the Barracks) recruit additional units.
  - If a kingdom stays at 0% for more then 72 hours, the NPC will take the kingdom. It is considered abandoned.

> ### ATTN!
> 
> In theory a single player who can walk on water can settle 14700 kingdoms (for the surface map) as well as any other plane of existence. To settle that many kingdoms you would need: ~147 million gold.
>
> It should also be noted there is no way for you spend real world money to increase resources per hour,
> decrease building or unit recruitment time. How ever there are special quest items you can get from playing the game (and only from playing) that will decrease the recruitment and upgrade time by a small percentage.
