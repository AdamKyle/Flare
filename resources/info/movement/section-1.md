# Movement

![Map]( /storage/info/movement/images/map.png)

As you can see from the above image, Tlessa comes with a map that you can move around on and see your position.

> ### ATTN! 
>
> For mobile players you can still interact with the map, you may not be able to "tap" on locations
> to bring up the modal to see details of that location, but you can always refer to the [locations]()
> table to see what's at a specific location.

As you can see in the image, there is an orange icon on top of a blue icon. This indicates the player is at a port location. As you can also see there are some buttons for moving in direction, embarking on an adventure, setting sail and of course teleporting.

The map is draggable and will move with your character as they enter the edge of the map and beyond.

> ## ATTN!
>
> **Adventure** and **Set Sail** only appear if you are on a location that has an adventure or a port (for sailing). Some locations can be both, some locations might be one or the other or none at all.

## Timeout

For moving, setting sail, adventuring and teleporting, there is a timeout that happens. This time out will last as long as indicated by the timer by the action.

- Moving is 10 seconds
- Teleporting is Distanced determined in minutes.
- [Adventuring](/information/adventure) is determined based on levels * time per level in minutes (or hours).
