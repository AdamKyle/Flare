# Notifications

The game comes with a few ways to notify you. One is through the notifications center at the top right of the screen.

As well as notifications that can be in chat:

Which are called server notifications.

Players can also be emailed if they are not online and have those settings turned on. The only time we will email you is in the following situations where **you are not online**:

- Adventure you were on completed.
- Class Damage Stat was changed.
- Item was deleted or affix was deleted.
- Skill was added to your character.
- You were banned.
- You can speak again.
- You were unbanned.
- Your request to be unbanned was ignored.

If you are online, most of the above will display in chat. as you can see in the second image above.

## Server notifications in chat

The chat area is extremly important to pay attention to. Messages about being out of gold for completing things such as enchanting/crafting or being told you have to wait for the appropriate timer to finish - all of these and more can appear in chat.
