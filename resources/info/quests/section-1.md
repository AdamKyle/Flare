Planes of Tlessa has what are called quests which are nothing more then you making sure you have a quest item and/or the currency.

Quests can be completed by speaking with the appropriate npc and their location. They will take the item and currencies, reward you with either currencies, new item or unlock a skill. Or in some cases – all three.

To get started, lets look at an example quest: Alchemy.

Lets first see what we need in alchemy. Go ahead and click the link above to see what we need to do to unlock the skill.

All done? Great! So we need to kill a Celestial Treasure Goblin to get Alchemist Tools to then trade to this NPC via being at their location and typing `/m NPCName: Quest`, you’ll replace NPCName with the actual name of the NPC.

As you noticed, the Alchemist Tools have a 1% chance to drop! It also requires some gold and gold dust to conjure. So first we need to either train crafting and enchanting to enchant some low level items we can then disenchant from our inventory, or we have to go to the market board and purchase some cheap items to disenchant.

We could also just farm adventures and fight monsters for drops.

Got some gold Dust? Great, lets conjure the Celestial Entity!

Now that we have defeated the celestial entity and got the reward (this could take a few tries for you as it is a 1% drop) lets turn it in.

First message the npc to see where they are, in this example they are at:

Next move to them, yes you have to be at their exact coordinates.

Next message them. Look at that! We unlocked a new skill!

That’s all there is to quests. If the NPC has multiple quests and you have all the items and associated currencies, the NPC will only do one quest at a time. This means you would have to re-message the NPC again to complete the next quest, and so on.
