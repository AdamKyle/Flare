## Base Damage, Armour Class (AC) and Skill Bonuses

As you were looking through the various races and classes you might have noticed a few extra bits of details, such as Accuracy, Dodge and Looting Modifier and the Defence Modifier.

Both races and classes provide these additional bits of information.

**Looting**: Refers to your chance to get gold rushes and drops from the enemy. This is also a skill that you can level up over time. The higher the skill bonus percentage, the higher the chance of you getting an item.

**Accuracy**: Your chance to hit the enemy. We take this skills bonus into account when you are fighting monsters. The higher the bonus, the higher the chance to hit the enemy.

**Dodge**: Your chance to dodge the enemies attach. We take this skill bonus into account when you are trying to dodge the incoming attack. The higher the bonus, the higher the chance to dodge.

**Defence Modifier**: This is added to the characters total AC. AC starts with a base of 10. Equipping armor and items that give bonuses to the defence modifier along with bonuses to the AC will increase the characters ability to not take any damage.
