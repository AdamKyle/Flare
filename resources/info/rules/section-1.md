      this is a bannable offense.

      - Failure to heed the above rule so will result in a permanent ban. 
      - Scripts or other tools that automate the multiple boxes/accounts is also a bannable offense.

## Security Questions:

For an added extra layer of security when you create your character you will be asked to select security questions. These must be unique questions and so must their answers.

The answers must also be at least 4 characters long.

**Do not post these in chat. You will put your account security at risk.**

These security questions will never be asked for by any Admin or moderator of the system, in any form. The only time they are asked for is by the following forms:

- Password Reset
- Requesting an Unban

Never forget your security questions answers.

## Character Creation Rules:

Names containing racial slurs or offensive terms will be forced to change their name. Any attempt to get around this is a bannable offense

- 1. Character names may not have special characters in them.
- 2. Character names may not have spaces
- 3. Character names must be between 5 and 15 characters long.
- 4. Charcater names may only container Letters of any case and numbers.

If a name is deemed offensive The Creator can force a name change, this will show a popup modal to the user immediatly and cannot be dismissed.

Even if you log out. The second you login again the forced name change modal will be there.

Any use of scripts or third party tools to hide or remove the box and continue on playing will result in a permananent ban.

## Chat Rules:

- 1. Do not post any private data. That includes, but not limited to: Your real name, address, email address, phone number, credit cards, log in details.

- 3. **Chat is self moderated**. Chat will for the most part, aside from rules written here, moderate themselves. How ever it should be noted that all chat history is kept and unencrypted. The Admin can, at any time, see any message including private messages. While we will not jump in and moderate chat we will be looking for suspicious activity and applying the appropriate punishments if needed.
- 4. You can only send 25 messages every two minutes. Failure to heed this will result in the game self silencing you for five minutes.

- 6. **NEVER** Give away your secret answers for your security questions. The Creator will never ask for these in any form.

## Getting Banned

There are three types of bans in Tlessa.

Users who are banned fall into three categories: 

- 1 day ban 
- 1 week ban 
- For ever.

If you think you were banned unfailrly, you can click on the "banned unfairly" link on the login page. You will "login" and provide a reason why you think you were banned unfairly.

From here you will enter your email, security questions and provide a reason why you think you were banned unfairy.

The administrator will then be alerted and process your request.

> Repeated requests to be unbanned will be ignored by the system. All decisions are final.
