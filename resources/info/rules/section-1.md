# Rules

Tlessa doesn't have many rules. How ever the few rules we do have, need to be followed or they can result in a permanent ban. Lets discuss what those rules are shall we?

- 1. Multiple accounts are allowed. 
  - 1a. All accounts are linked by IP. This means that if any account is banned for any length of time all accounts tied to that IP are also banned for that length of time. Any attempt to circumvent this is a bannable offense.
    - **Exception**: If you or your spouse or family member all play this game, and one of you gets banned - since all bans are IP based and in this situation we assume you all share the same IP, if any other person is able to verify they are not linked to the banned account, that is via email and character name as well as other security measures - That particular character may be unbanned.
  - 1b. Multi boxing is allowed.
    - Players may not send more then one request per action to each box.
      - Failure to heed the above rule so will result in a permanent ban. 
      - Scripts or other tools that automate the multiple boxes/accounts is also a bannable offense.
  - 1c. Scripts or attempts to use back end API's with out authorization from **The Creator** for any purpose is a bannable offense.
  - 1d. Attempts to exploit bugs will result in a permenant ban.
  - 1e. Third party tools and attempts to circumvent the games core rules is also a bannable offense.
- 2. Gold Selling or any form of real world currency trade is not allowed and any account participating will be banned permantly.
- 3. Character selling is a bannable offense.
- 4. Using any third party service to get around a "For ever" ban (see Getting Banned below) will also result in another ban.


## Character Creation Rules:

Names containing racial slurs or offensive terms will be asked to rename their character (which The Creator will do with the provided name) or will be banned permantly.

- 1. Character names may not have special characters in them.

## Chat Rules:

- 1. Do not post any private data. That includes, but not limited to: Your real name, address, email address, phone number, credit cards, log in details.
  - 1a. The Creator, or any other admin of the game, will never EVER ask you for any of this information, in any form be it email or other wise.
    - **Exception**: If the event one member of your house hold using the same IP, was recently banned, you will be asked to fill out a form on the site and from there based on those details you provide the character will either be unbanned or not. How ever at no time will you recieve an email asking you for any personal details or account details. (*see below in Getting Banned*).
- 2. Racial Slurs, Threats of death, Personal character attacks or attacks on the person of any kind, be it their race, sexual identity, heritiage, ectra... Will not be tolerated and will start with a 10 minute silence and progress to a permananet ban at The Creator's disgrestion.
- 3. **Chat is self moderated**. Chat will for the most part, aside from rules written here, moderate themselves. How ever it should be noted that all chat history is kept and unencrypted. The Admin can at any time see any message including private messages. While we will not jump in and moderate chat we will be looking for suspicious activity and applying the appropriate punishments if needed.
- 4. You can only send 25 messages every two minutes. Failure to heed this will result in the game self silencing you for five minutes.
  - 4a. The Creator can silence you for 10, 30 and 60 minutes. During this time you will not be able to chat at all.
  - 4b. When the time out is finished you will see a message in chat telling you, you can chat again.
- 5. No auction is to take place in chat, you want to sell something, use the market board. Failure to heed this, will result in 10 minute chat time outs followed by bans for repeated offenses.

## Getting Banned

There are three types of bans in Tlessa. All of them will ban all characters that share the same IP address. Any attempts to get around this such as VPN's and other services that spoof your IP will result in another permananent ban.

Users who are banned fall into three categories: 1 day ban, 1 week ban and For ever.

If you think you were banned unfailrly, you can click on the "I was banned" link on the login page. You will "login" and provide a reason why you think you were banned unfairly.

> ### ATTN!
>
> Because multiple people from the same household might be playing on the same IP, they can use the same steps and provide their character name, the reason they think they were banned unfairly, their security questions and submit the form. From there The Creator will review the details and get back to you in 24 hours with a response. You'll either get an automated message telling you that you were unbanned or message that states why you will not be unbanned.
>
> Further attempts to get your character unbanned after getting banned (and being told you will not be unbanned) will be ignored.
