# Skill Information

-------------------

When creating your character you are given a set number of skills. Your race and class will always affect your accuracy and your dodge skill.

All skills start at level 0 and can to either level 100 or 400 if it's a crafting skill. You can see the skill table below.

## Skill Break Down

Lets break down whats all in a skill:

- **Base Damage Modifier**: This affects your core damage. If a skill incriments this, then it is calculated into the dmage done to the creature at the time of the attack, assuming the attack landed successfully.
- **Base Healing Modifier**: This affects your healing amount when you use spells to heal. In battle these spells will trigger automatically assuming you have a healing spell equipped.
- **Base AC Modifier**: This affects your deffense. This affects weather you block an attack or not. This combined with your base AC is used to determine if the monster can do damage.
