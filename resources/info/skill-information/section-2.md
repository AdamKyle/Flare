## Training Skills

When it comes to training skills there are two ways to train: **Fight** or **Craft**. Thats it.

If a skill can be trained, you can head to your character sheet and click train on the desired skill. From here you can decide how much XP you are willing to sacrafice per fight to train that skill. You sacrafice as little as 10% to a maximum of 100%. All skills are xp based.

As you fight you will train that skill over time.

For crafting skills, you have to physically craft items of that type. For example on the game page, you can click additional actions and select craft. From there you can select the type of item to craft and then the item its sef. [Learn more about Crafting]().

As you craft items you will train your crafting skill for that type.

## Leveling Skills

When a skill levels up you will see that in chat. If you are doing an adventure and you have logged out and have a skill training, you will see the new level when you collect your rewards from that adventure, assuming you have successfully completed the adventure and that the adventure rewards enough xp to level the skill.

## Skill XP

When a skill levels there are two ways the next level xp is claculated. That is the xp needed to go fro level 2-3 for example.

**For skills that can be trained**: This value is between 50 and 100 xp needed to level the skill.
**For crafting skills**: This value is between 100 and 150xp needed to level that skill.

## Skill Training Modifiers

Some [items, quest items and affixes]() will contain things that affect the training of a skill. For example Lets say you find an item that contains a bonus of 150% (youll find these with [crafting]() books) xp towards the xp. That would mean every time you suceede in killing a monster or crating an item an extra bonus of xp is handed out.

Some of these items are easy to come by, such as visiting ports or doing adventures. While others have a tiny drop rate of 1% or less. Your Looting skill would help in achieving these.
