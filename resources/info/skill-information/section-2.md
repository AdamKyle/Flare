## Skill Break Down

Lets break down whats all in a skill, you can see this information by clicking on a skill above:

- **Base Damage Modifier**: This affects your core damage. If a skill incriments this, then it is calculated into the dmage done to the creature at the time of the attack, assuming the attack landed successfully.
- **Base Healing Modifier**: This affects your healing amount when you use spells to heal. In battle these spells will trigger automatically assuming you have a healing spell equipped.
- **Base AC Modifier**: This affects your deffense. This affects weather you block an attack or not. This combined with your base AC is used to determine if the monster can do damage.

> You will see these through out this guide. These three modifier attributes can also exist on artificats, quest items, enchanted items and even regular items them selves.

- **Fight Timeout Modifier**: With every kill, comes a timeout of 10 seconds, 20 if the enemy has killed you. These modifiers take a specific percentage off your timer. [Learn more about timers](/information/time-gates)
- **Can Train**: Can this skill be trained? See the skill table below.
- **Skill Bonus Per Level**: The percentage bonus applied per level up.

When viewing your character skeet, you will see a list of skills. Each one of those skills can be clicked on to get releavent details about said skill and about where you are in training that skill.

## Additional skills can be added

Overtime The Creator can add new skills or modify existing ones. If the skills if modified you will not be notified, these would be balancing changes that The Creator will inform the players of.

How ever if a new skill is created and assigned to all players, then every player will be notified of a new skill. If you are logged in, you'll see it in chat, if not, you'll be emailed.

If additional skills are added, youll be able to see details in game via the character sheet section as well as on this page.

## Training skills

When it comes to training skills there are two ways to train: **Fight** or **Craft**. Thats it.

>
> There is also no way, aside from [adventures](/information/adventure) (for fight based skills only), to train these via ideling.

If a skill can be trained, you can head to your character sheet and click train on the desired skill.

    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/character-sheet.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

From here you can decide how much XP you are willing to sacrafice per fight to train that skill. You sacrafice as little as 10% to a maximum of 100%. All skills are xp based.

    <img src="/storage/info/skill-information/images/skill-training.png" class="img-fluid" />
</a>

As you fight you will train that skill over time.

**The more XP you put towards a skill, the less you get in return to level. For example, putting 100% into Looting means all battle (even adventure) XP goes towards that skill.**

For crafting skills, you have to physically craft items of that type. For example on the game page, you can click additional actions and select craft. From there you can select the type of item to craft and then the item its sef. [Learn more about Crafting]().

As you craft items you will train your crafting skill for that type. Over time you'll get new items of that type to craft.

As you enchant it's the same thing, how ever you'll get more enchantments (or Affixes) to attach on the item.

> When you are training a skill, you are effectivly using that skill. How ever, when it comes to skills that are affecting things like looting or 
> attacking, such as increasing your Base Damage with a modifer, the level you put in those specific skills will automatically be applied
> even if you are not activly training that skill.
>
> For example if you start training Looting, after putting 5 levels into Accuracy, when you go to attack those five levels (of Accuracy) will be taken into account 
> when determining if you can hit or not automatically. This makes training multiple skills to their max level benificial for creating optimized characters.

## Leveling Skills

When you are fighting and your skill levels up, you'll see it popup in chat.

If you are doing an adventure and you have logged out and have a skill training, you will see the new level when you collect your rewards from that adventure, assuming you have successfully completed the adventure and that the adventure rewards enough xp to level the skill.

[Learn more about adventuring](/information/adventure).

## Skill XP

When a skill levels there are two ways the next level xp is claculated. That is the xp needed to go fro level 2-3 for example.

- **For skills that can be trained**: This value is between 100 and 150 xp needed to level the skill.
- **For crafting skills**: This value is between 100 and 200xp needed to level that skill.

## Skill Training Modifiers

Some [items, quest items and affixes]() will contain things that affect the training of a skill. For example Lets say you find an item that contains a bonus of 150% (you'll find these with [crafting](/information/crafting) books) xp towards the xp gained for a success of doing that skill.

Every time you craft and item, or enchant, and you have that item in your inventory, you'll get the 150% xp boost on top of what you would get for practicing the skill - which is always base of 10.

Some of these items are easy to come by, such as visiting ports or doing adventures. While others have a tiny drop rate of 1% or less. Your Looting skill would help in achieving these.
