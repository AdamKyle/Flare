# Teleporting

Teleporting works much the same way as setting sail. Assuming you can move and are not dead, you can open the teleport section, by clicking teleport on the map.

[Teleport]

From here you can select the coordinates, which then show you the cost in gold, and the time out value.

From here you can click teleport to go instantly to that new location assuming:
