# Usable Items

There are three types of items in Tlessa: Equip, Quest and Usable.

Usable items allow you to exactly as they state. For example, maybe you have items that increase stats for a period-of-time 
(in minutes) or maybe you have items that do damage to kingdoms.

These items can only be crafted (or purchased from the market board), can be sold on the market board 
and require both Shards and Gold dust (see Currencies).

These items cannot be destroyed or disenchanted.

These items require you to have access to Alchemy skill.

Crafting these items is done the same way as crafting a weapon. As you level the Alchemy skill, 
more items will be unlocked at their appropriate levels, see table below.

## Using Items

There are two ways to use items, either via the inventory or when attacking a kingdom.

Using an item via the inventory you can choose to click “Use all” which will use 
all applicable non kingdom damaging items. These items can affect stats, skill bonuses and skill xp. 
You can also use the drop-down to use specific items, one at a time.

When using kingdom damaging items, you must be at the kingdom you wish to drop them on. You can use as many items in one attack as you want.

## Stat and Skill items

When using these types of usable items, their bonuses will stack. So, feel free to use as many items as you want on yourself.

These items will not stack in the sense that you use 10 items that each last 10 minutes and increase all stats by .05% that it 
will be: 50 minutes and 50%. Instead, its 10 minutes for each item you use and 50% total. This way if you use 1 item then another 
5 minutes later that affect the same thing, yes, they will stack (bonus and stat wise), but their times will end differently.

Using an item on the character sheet, while you have the game open in another tab will update stats in the game tab and skill bonuses 
automatically. You will also be told via chat when these items wear off.

## Kingdom Damaging Items

These items, as stated, must be used while at the kingdom you wish to attack. These will do damage to the kingdom’s 
buildings and units. Any morale damage suffered only happens when applicable buildings (see me, investigate buildings table) 
durability hit 0.

The defender will be told of each item and how much % wise it did to the kingdom.

Chat will then see a global message go out.

> None of the useable items can be bought with real world money. You can, as stated, buy them from the market board with gold only.
